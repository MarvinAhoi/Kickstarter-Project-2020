# Kickstarter-Project-2020

In this project I analyse together with my team partner 54 different data sets from Kickstarter. Our goal was to find out which features have an impact on a successful project. Besides we have initiated different models to predict which project will be successful an which will be failed. We have gone through the entire data science lifecycle during processing these tasks. A part of our results can be found in the presentation in this repository.
